# Chunky Configuration

# General settings
world-border: true  # Use world borders to limit the chunk generation area
progress-bar: true
progress-log: false  # Disable logging for reduced disk I/O
pause-for-players: true
safe-mode: true

# Chunk loading and generation
threads: 2  # Use fewer threads to reduce CPU and memory usage (increase only if server has excess CPU)
batch-size: 8  # Smaller batch size to minimize impact on TPS and MSPT
delay: 5  # Increase delay to reduce strain on the server; 5 ticks provides a balance

# World generation
generate-structures: false  # Disable to reduce processing time and memory usage
generate-oceans: false  # Disable unnecessary ocean generation
generate-caves: false  # Disable if caves are not needed
generate-mountains: false  # Disable mountain generation to save resources
generate-nether: false  # Only enable if generating the Nether; keep false otherwise
generate-end: false  # Only enable if generating the End; keep false otherwise

# Chunk processing
keep-loaded: false  # Unload chunks after generation to free up memory
lighting: false  # Disable lighting data generation to reduce CPU and memory usage
height-limit: 128  # Lower the height limit if you do not need the full 256 blocks (default height for most servers)

# Logging
verbose-logging: false  # Keep logging minimal to reduce disk usage and processing overhead
error-log: true  # Only log errors to avoid clutter

# Safety settings
memory-threshold: 80  # Lower memory threshold to pause generation earlier and prevent crashes
tps-threshold: 19.0  # Keep TPS threshold high to ensure server performance stays optimal

# Backup and restoration
auto-backup: false  # Disable backups during generation to save on disk I/O; do manual backups instead
backup-interval: 1h  # Increase backup interval if auto-backup is needed (otherwise, keep it disabled)

# Pause conditions
pause-on-player-join: true
pause-on-player-move: true
pause-on-world-save: true  # Ensure that generation pauses during world saves to maintain stability

# Optimization flags
use-async-chunk-loading: true  # Keep asynchronous loading enabled for smoother performance
use-async-lighting: false  # Disable async lighting to further reduce CPU usage

# Advanced options
auto-resume: true  # Automatically resume generation after a pause
stop-on-error: true  # Halt the process if an error is encountered
save-state: true  # Save the generation state to resume later if needed
